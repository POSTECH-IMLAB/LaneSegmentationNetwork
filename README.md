# Overview
The semantic segmentaion network for lane segmentation. Which inspired by Google DeepLabV3.

# Performance
We conduct the experiments on [Highway Driving Dataset for Semantic Video Segmentation](https://sites.google.com/site/highwaydrivingdataset/) from KAIST, achieving the test set performance 86.5% mIoU.
